## Basic

A simple TkInput display.

<Basic />

## Password

The input field is visually masked to securely hide the characters entered, providing a standard password entry experience.

<Password />

## Counter

This input field includes a counter feature that allows users to increment or decrement numerical values. The + and - buttons inside the input let users easily adjust the value.

<Counter />

## Mask

The maskOptions prop is used to define masking configurations supported by the Cleave.js library. With this prop, you can specify any masking options described in the Cleave.js documentation (https://nosir.github.io/cleave.js/). For example, you can configure it for formatting dates, phone numbers, or credit card numbers as needed.
