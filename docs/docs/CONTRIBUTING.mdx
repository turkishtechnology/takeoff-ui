# Contributing to Takeoff UI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Takeoff UI Design System! Whether you’re a community contributor or a core team member, this guide will help you navigate our project structure, issue management, commit message guidelines, and pull request process.

---

## Project Overview

The Takeoff UI Design System is a monorepo built using:

- **Core Web Components**: Developed with [Stencil.js](https://stenciljs.com/) (`@takeoff-ui/core`)
- **Monorepo Management**: Managed with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/) (`turbo`)
- **Framework-Specific Targets**:
  - `@takeoff-ui/react`
  - `@takeoff-ui/vue`
  - `@takeoff-ui/angular`
- **Tailwind Plugin**: `@takeoff-ui/tailwind`

**Directory Structure:**
```plaintext
packages/
├── core/      # Core web components
├── react/     # React wrapper library
├── vue/       # Vue wrapper library
├── angular/   # Angular wrapper library
└── tailwind/  # Tailwind plugin for the design system
```

## Code Standards

All contributions must follow our [Coding Standards](/docs/Coding-Standards) covering:

- Stencil.js component architecture
- Cross-framework compatibility
- Testing requirements (coverage)
- Design system variable usage

---

## Issue Management

We use **GitHub Issues** for bug reports and feature requests. Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

### Available Issue Templates

When you click **New issue** in our repo, choose one of the following templates (they live under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`):

- **Bug Report**
- **New Feature Request**

Follow the prompts in the template you select and fill in all required sections.

---

## For Community Contributors

### Claim an Issue

- Issues will be labeled by the Core Team first.
- Look for issues which are not labeled as **Core Team**, available issues can be self-assigned when identified.

### Branch Naming

Use the format:
```plaintext
{type}/{issue-number}-{short-description}
```
- `type` = feature, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore  
- `issue-number` = the GitHub issue number (e.g. `123`)  
- `short-description` = brief, kebab-case summary  

Example:  
```plaintext
feature/123-add-loading-state
```

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. Click **Compare & pull request**.
3. Reference the issue in your PR title:  
   ```plaintext
   #123: Add loading state to Button component
   ```
4. Fill out our PR template (you’ll see it pre-populated).

---

## For Core Team

- **Sprint Management**  
    Maintain sprint assignments via GitHub Projects or through our corporate Jira environment (as configured).
- **Labeling & Milestones**  
  Move issues between columns and update milestones as work progresses.
- **Release Notes**  
  Tag PRs with version labels and draft release notes when closing a version cycle.

---

## Commit Guidelines

We follow a conventional-style commit format:

```plaintext
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- **type**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore  
- **scope**: affected package or area (e.g. `tk-button`, `core`)  
- **subject**: short imperative description (≤ 75 chars)  

**Examples:**
```plaintext
feat(tk-button): Add loading state animation
chore(deps): Bump stenciljs to v3.5.0
```

- Use **imperative mood** (“add”, “fix”, “update”)
- Capitalize the subject (no trailing period)
- If needed, include a body separated by a blank line
- Reference issues by number (e.g. `Closes #123`)

---

## Pull Request Guidelines

Our PR template will guide you through these sections:

```markdown
### Description
Explain your changes in 1–2 sentences.

### Related Issue
Closes #123

### Testing Steps
1. Step 1
2. Step 2

### Screenshots
