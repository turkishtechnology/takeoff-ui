## Striped

To enable striped mode, set the striped prop to true. This feature displays rows with alternating background colors.

## Header Type

The headerType prop is used to change the style of the table headers and allows you to customize the headers' style with values such as basic, primary, and dark.

## Selection

This feature allows users to select rows in the table. The selected rows are visually highlighted and can be used for various actions.

## Filter and Sorting

The table supports three types of filtering:

- Text input filtering: Allows free text search in columns
- Checkbox filtering: Enables selecting multiple values from predefined options
- Radio filtering: Allows selecting a single value from predefined options

The filtering type can be configured using the `filterType` property in column definition. For checkbox and radio filters, you need to provide `filterOptions` with value-label pairs.

<TkAlert
  header="Information"
  message='It does not work when paginationType = "server". In this case, filtering and sorting should be done by the backend. See serverSide'
